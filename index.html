                The practice is not in network with insurance panels. A superbill can be provided after payment for potential out of network reimbursement.
                Please confirm benefits, deductibles, and reimbursement rates with your insurance company in advance.

                ADOS 2 stands for Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule, 2nd Edition.
                It is a structured evaluation used alongside other measures to support diagnostic decisions about autism spectrum disorder.
                It is rarely used in isolation and is typically one part of a comprehensive evaluation.
